# How to QA a challenge
Challenge has to meet these criteria:
- Documentation is done?
- Make the challenge exist on the scoreboard (ask C-Sto / sudosammy for creds)
- Remember to add to the challenge description where the game is. e.g.

a) "File drop name: Forensics-2.txt"

b) "[color=#4edf47]challenge.capture.tf:4400[/color]"

- Use BB code to prettify links/IP addresses: [color=#4edf47][url=http://hats.com]http://hats.com[/url][/color]

- Point allocation:

  -T0: 10 - 50

  -T1: 100

  -T2: 150

  -T3: 200

  -T4: 250

- Challenge works out of the box? - any fucking around necessary for a challenge organiser to get the challenge working should be heavily frowned upon and the challenge should go back to the builder for automating.
- Does the PoC work?
- Game doesn't require reverting or fucking around?
- Is the flag the correct format?
- Is the flag the same as in the documentation?
- Can it broken badly in some other way?
- Does it fit the tier that it's meant for? - refer to table in challenge documentation

# Challenge needs updates?
1) Send it to individual responsible - tell them to let you know once the changes have been made
2) Update progress.md to QP status (internal)
3) Wait for it to come back

# Challenge has come back after changes being made
1) Update progress.md to Q (name) status (internal)
2) Do the QA process again.
3) Rinse repeat until it passes
4) Update progress.md status to R (internal)

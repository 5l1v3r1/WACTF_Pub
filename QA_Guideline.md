# How to QA a challenge
Challenge has to meet these criteria:
- You know who made the challenge?
- Documentation is done?
- Make the challenge exist on the scoreboard
- Point allocation:
  -T1: 100
  -T2: 150
  -T3: 200
  -T4: 250
- Challenge works out of the box? - any fucking around necessary for a challenge organiser to get the challenge working should be heavily frowned upon and the challenge should go back to the builder for automating.
- Does the PoC work?
- Game doesn't require reverting or fucking around?
- Is the flag the correct format? - refer to build documentation
- Is the flag the same as in the documentation?
- Can it broken badly in some other way?
- Does it fit the tier that it's meant for? - refer to table in challenge documentation

# Challenge needs updates?
1) Send it to individual responsible - tell them to let you know once the changes have been made
2) Update progress.md to QP status
3) Wait for it to come back


# Challenge has come back after changes being made
1) Update progress.md to Q (name) status
2) Do the QA process again.
3) Rinse repeat until it passes
4) Update progress.md status to R
